# Description:
The image shows a cloud-based architecture for an AI solution, emphasizing operational, data, and application layers, as well as subscription vending and network provisioning. Below is a conceptual representation using Mermaid code for the structural relationships:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User((User))
    User --> OperationalLayer[Operational Layer]
    OperationalLayer --> KeyVault[Key Vault]
    OperationalLayer --> Monitor[Monitor]
    OperationalLayer --> AzureManagement[Azure Management Services]

    OperationalLayer --> AppLayer[App Layer]
    AppLayer --> AgentOne[Shopper Agent]
    AppLayer --> AgentTwo[Worker Agent]
    AppLayer --> AgentThree[Inventory Agent]
    AppLayer --> LightAgent[Light Agents]
    AppLayer --> Foundry[Azure AI Foundry]

    AppLayer --> AIServices[Azure AI Services]
    AIServices --> Vision[Vision APIs]
    AIServices --> Speech[Speech Services]
    AIServices --> NLP[Natural Language Processing]
    AIServices --> AzureAgent[Azure AI Bots]

    OperationalLayer --> DataSources[Data Sources]
    DataSources --> Logs[System Logs]
    DataSources --> Schema[Custom Schema Data]
    DataSources --> Pretrain[Pretrained Models]
    DataSources --> SQL[SQL Data]

    Subscription[Subscription Vending]
    Subscription --> VirtualNetwork[Virtual Network]
    Subscription --> Connectivity[Connectivity Subscription]
    Subscription --> Platform[Platform Services]
```

This is a simplification of the architecture and may not contain every detail.
